# 🧠 CalypsoBCI  
**Building context-aware wearables**

---

### 🌊 About Us  
At **Calypso**, we are building a future where technology adapts seamlessly to its user. Our work sits at the intersection of **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)**, **Augmented Reality (AR)**, **Wearable Computing** and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** — enabling intuitive, context-aware systems that respond to mental states, attention, and intention.

---

### 🔬 Current Focus  
Our first project, **Calypso Beam**, combines EEG-based BCI and AR to empower users to interact with digital environments using **brain and gaze activity** — designed especially for individuals with limited motor control.  

**Calypso Beam AR glasses** allow users to control a **smartphone or laptop hands-free**. The interface of the device is projected into AR space, while our **Hybrid-BCI system** interprets neural and eye signals to enable seamless device control.  

Key features:
- Hands-free control of smartphones and laptops  
- AR projection of device interface into the user’s visual space  
- Hybrid-BCI integrating EEG and gaze signals for reliable interaction  
- Optimized for accessibility and daily real-world use

### 🧠 Research & Development  
We collaborate with **the University of Oldenburg** and **GIZ Startup Incubator**, uniting neuroscience, engineering, and design to push the boundaries of real-world BCI applications.

Key research areas:
- BCI stability across sessions and contexts  
- EEG signal fusion and decision-level algorithms  
- Cognitive load and user experience optimisation  
- Low-power embedded BCI systems for wearable AR

### 🌍 Vision  
We believe that the next revolution will be **context aware computing and wearables** —  
a world where devices understand **user contexts**, **intention**, and **emotion** as effortlessly as touch or voice.
